Those of you who want to get 9CP for this course will need to complete a final project. 

Specifically, you may choose between two possible routes for this project.

## Theoretical: Exploring Topics through Geometric or Probabilistic Formalization
For the theoretical route, you will be asked to write a report of 5-10 pages about a topic of your choice, in which you elaborate on the formalization from either a geometric or probabilistic perspective. Here, the main goal is for you to showcase your understanding of geometric or probabilistic perspectives, drawing upon the fundamental concepts and methodologies covered in this course.

For the topic, you may choose any statistical method that interests you, provided you get my approval first.
