<p> In this course, we will embark on an exploration of central topics in multivariate statistics. 
  As the class is intended for advanced Bachelor's or early Master's students, it is likely that you have heard with or studied several of these topics before - however, my aim is to provide a fresh and more fundamental perspective on these concepts, fostering a deeper understanding and encouraging you to learn how to approach multivariate statistics from different angles.    </p>
